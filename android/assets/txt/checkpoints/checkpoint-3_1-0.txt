In Java, we write most of our code in methods and then call
these methods to execute their code.

When we write our code, we divide its logic into smaller
parts (methods) to make it more understandable, easier to
maintain, reusable and much more.
The more experience you get in programming, the more you will
understand why and how to divide your code into methods.
