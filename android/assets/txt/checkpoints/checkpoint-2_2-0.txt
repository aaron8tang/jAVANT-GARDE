In programming, you will be using variables to store and
process data like a name, age, height, gender etc.

After declaring a variable, you can assign a value to it.
You may later change a variable's value, use it in calculations,
print it on the user's screen and more.
A variable may only store a value of its type.
For example, an int variable can store the number 15 but
not the decimal number 1,5 or a text like "Hello World!".
First of all, you will have to learn how to assign a value to
a variable!
