VARIABLE TYPE:
A variable stores [RED]data[]. The data must have a [RED]type[].
It could be a number, a letter, a whole sentence etc.

When declaring a variable, the variable's [RED]type[] must be defined.
To do that, you must use a specific [ORANGE]keyword[] from Java's reserved words.
Some of the basic types and their definition keywords in Java are:

real        (any real number: 0.36, -0.7, 10 etc.)         [ORANGE]double[]
boolean     (only 2 possible values: true or false)        [ORANGE]boolean[]
character   (any single character from the keyboard)       [ORANGE]char[]
string      (a sequence of characters - e.g. a sentence)   [ORANGE]String[]
