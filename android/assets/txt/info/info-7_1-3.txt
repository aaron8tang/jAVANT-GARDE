Most of the time we will have to assign this [ORANGE]instance[] of the object we created
to a variable.
Until now, we have learned some of the [CYAN]primitive types[] of variables:
[CYAN]int, double, boolean, char[]

But a variable may have a [RED]class type[] instead.
To create a variable of class type, we use the [RED]name[] of that class as its type:
e.g.
    [RED]Dog[] myDogVariable = [ORANGE]new Dog()[];

Now, we can have access to the [GREEN]fields[] and [BLUE]methods[] of the class through
the variable 'myDogVariable'. We will get to that soon.
