ACCESS MODIFIERS:
[PURPLE]Access modifiers[] are used to control whether other classes can have access to
a [RED]class[], its [GREEN]fields[] and [BLUE]methods[]. The 4 access modifiers are:

[PURPLE]public[]    : can be accessed by any other class
[PURPLE]default[][ORANGE]*[]  : can be accessed by any class in the same folder (package)
[PURPLE]protected[] : same as [PURPLE]default[] + a subclass can access a superclass field or method [MAGENTA]*[]
[PURPLE]private[]   : can be accessed only by the class itself
[RED]Classes can only be public or default. Fields and methods can be any of the above.[]
[ORANGE]*[] When we use the [PURPLE]default[] modifier we don't actually write it, we omit it.
[MAGENTA]*[] Subclasses and superclasses will be explained later on (inheritance)

[CYAN]___The conventional (object-oriented) way of writing a class:_______________________[]
[PURPLE]public[] [RED]class Dog {
    [GREEN][PURPLE]private[] String name; [LIGHT_GRAY]//fields shouldn't be accessed directly from another class[]
    [PURPLE]private[] int age;       [LIGHT_GRAY]//that's why they should be private. We will see how[]
    [PURPLE]private[] boolean hungry;[]   [LIGHT_GRAY]//they should be accessed in the next level[]
  	
    [PURPLE]public[] [BLUE]void run() {
    }

    [PURPLE]public[] void bark() {
    }[]
}[]
