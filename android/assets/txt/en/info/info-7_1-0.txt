OBJECTS:
An object in programming is similar to an object in real life.
Any [YELLOW]object[] in real life has a [CYAN]state[] and a [CYAN]behavior[].

For example, a [YELLOW]dog[]:
[CYAN]state[]: name, breed, age, hungry
[CYAN]behavior[]: running, barking, eating

Now, in programming, an object's [CYAN]state[] is stored in [GREEN]fields[] (variables)
and its [CYAN]behavior[] is shown through [BLUE]methods[].

We create ([ORANGE]instantiate[]) these objects to access their data.
We'll get to that soon!
